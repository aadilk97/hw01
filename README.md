This repo was created as a part of the Homework 1 submission for CSC510 - Software Engineering, Fall 2020. The aim of this homework was to understand what a "good" repository looks like. Besides having a codebase, a good repositories should also be complete, readable and well documented.     

## File Descriptions

### <a href="./.gitignore"> .gitignore </a>
.gitignore tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It's usually used to avoid committing transient files from your working directory that aren't useful to other collaborators, such as compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.


### <a href="./.travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>
Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub and Bitbucket. Travis CI provides various paid plan for private projects, and a free plan for open source. TravisPro provides custom deployments of a proprietary version on the customer's own hardware. .travis.yml, which is a YAML format text file used to configure Travis CI. This file specifies the programming language used, the desired building and testing environment, including dependencies which must be installed before the software can be built and tested, and various other parameters.

### <a href="./requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>
The requirements.txt file is used with certain python projects. It is used to specify what python packages are required to run the project you are looking at.

### <a href="./CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>
A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in an open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project. It is usually meant for project woners, project contributers and project consumers. It is typically present at the root of the project.

### <a href="./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a>
A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file outlines all such community standards and procedures.

### <a href="./CITATIONS.md">CITATIONS.md</a>
Zenodo is a platform where you can permanently archive your code and other project elementsZenodo does this by assigning projects a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which also helps to make the work more citable.

### <a href="./setup.py">setup.py</a>
setup.py tells what module/package you are about to install. It allows you to easily install Python package.

### <a href="./README.md"> README.md</a>
