# Homework 1 - Group 15 
This repo was created as a part of the Homework 1 submission for CSC510 - Software Engineering, Fall 2020. The aim of this homework was to understand what a "good" repository looks like. Besides having a codebase, a good repositories should also be complete, readable and well documented.     

## File Descriptions

### <a href="./.gitignore"> .gitignore </a>
.gitignore tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It's usually used to avoid committing transient files from your working directory that aren't useful to other collaborators, such as compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.


### <a href="./.travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>
Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub and Bitbucket. Travis CI provides various paid plan for private projects, and a free plan for open source. TravisPro provides custom deployments of a proprietary version on the customer's own hardware. .travis.yml, which is a YAML format text file used to configure Travis CI. This file specifies the programming language used, the desired building and testing environment, including dependencies which must be installed before the software can be built and tested, and various other parameters.


###  <a href="./LICENSE">LICENSE</a>
We used the MIT License. The MIT license is one of the most permissive software licenses out there. Itâ€™s not only friendly to open source developers but also to businesses. Unlike other licenses, the MIT allows you to keep your source code private so long as you give credit in the license file along with a copyright notice.

### <a href="./requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>
The requirements.txt file is used with certain python projects. It is used to specify what python packages are required to run the project you are looking at.  Typically the requirements.txt file is located in the root directory of your project. It has each package name in a separate line along with the verison number (optional).

### <a href="./CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>
A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in an open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project. It is usually meant for project woners, project contributers and project consumers. It is typically present at the root of the project.

### <a href="./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a>
A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file outlines all such community standards and procedures.

### <a href="./CITATIONS.md">CITATIONS.md</a>
This file contains the ZENODO DOI badge. Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It allows researchers to deposit data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artifacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citeable.

### <a href="./setup.py">setup.py</a>
The setup.py script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, and installing modules using the setuptools or Distutils. The main purpose of the setup.py script is to describe your module distribution to the Distutils or setuptools, so that the various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing.

### <a href="./README.md"> README.md</a>
The current file you're reading! A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. It typically provides information on what the project does, how the project is useful, how users can get started with the project, where users can get help with your project, who maintains and contributes to the project. It can be formatted to look more presentable.
