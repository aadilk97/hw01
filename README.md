This repo was created as a part of the Homework 1 submission for CSC510 - Software Engineering, Fall 2020. The aim of this homework was to understand what a "good" repository looks like. Besides having a codebase, a good repositories should also be complete, readable and well documented.     

## File Descriptions

### <a href="./.gitignore"> .gitignore </a>
The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by git remain untracked. The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by git remain untracked. Say you run git add . from the root directory of your repo, and you have nothing ignored.

### .travis.yml
As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.

###  License?
The MIT license is a great choice because it allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code, it's business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization.

### requirements.txt
we generate and share requirements. txt files to make it easier for other developers to install the correct versions of the required Python libraries (or “packages”) to run the Python code we've written.

### CONTRIBUTING.md
A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group.

### CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community.

### CITATIONS.md
Zenodo is a platform where you can permanently archive your code and other project elementsZenodo does this by assigning projects a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which also helps to make the work more citable.

### setup.py
setup.py tells what module/package you are about to install. It allows you to easily install Python package.
